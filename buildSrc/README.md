# MusicKit SDK compatibility

The build supports the official MusicKit Android playback SDK 1.1.1. It validates
the supplied AAR and applies a narrowly scoped 64-bit catalog-ID compatibility
adjustment during compilation. The original SDK file remains unchanged and is
not included in source control.

The supplied playback and authentication AARs also omit JVM stack-map frames in
methods with branches. The build selects only affected classes present in those
AARs and uses AGP's `COMPUTE_FRAMES_FOR_INSTRUMENTED_CLASSES` mode to reconstruct
their verification metadata. It does not alter other SDK instructions, suppress
R8 warnings, or transform application and GeckoView classes.

After downloading the SDK, compatibility tests can be run with:

```sh
./gradlew -p buildSrc test --tests dev.amatv.build.MusicKitSongIdPatchTest
```
